# Delphi Design Patterns (PHP to Delphi Conversion)

This project aims to **convert Design Patterns** examples originally implemented in **PHP**, as presented in videos on YouTube, to the **Delphi** language (Object Pascal), using **Delphi 12 Community Edition**.

## 🎯 Objective

- Study and understand the main Design Patterns.
- Apply the patterns in the context of the Delphi language.
- Explore the equivalence of concepts between PHP and Delphi, such as inheritance, interfaces, abstract classes, polymorphism and composition.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools

- **Delphi 12 Community Edition**
- **Console Application** (without graphical interface)
- **Patterns studied so far**:
- Singleton
- Observer : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv9JxI85Ac8&list=PLNHxHgB-_LTt67szNmMsZwqBKq9jH4uKJ&index=7
- Strategy
- Decorator : https://youtu.be/7B60j9EGrrU?si=xrJHLjrzu7FB0vMm
- Factory Method : https://youtu.be/j5fGTi8ObK4?si=l3P2jbq-JPMf8Ajl
- etc.

## 📂 Project Structure

## 🧠 About the Original Project

The examples are based on a YouTube channel that teaches Design Patterns in **PHP**. I am using these examples as a basis to practice concepts in Delphi and understand how the same patterns can be applied in a strongly typed and object-oriented language like Delphi.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open Delphi 12.
2. Compile and run the project directly (example in console mode).
3. The results will be displayed in the terminal, simulating the behaviors of the design patterns.

## 📌 Notes

- All examples are being implemented in **command line** projects (without VCL/FMX).
- The focus is didactic, and the architecture can be adapted in the future for real applications with interface.
